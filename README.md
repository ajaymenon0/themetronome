# TheMetronome
An app for setting a bpm for a certain number of bars so that you can practise in peace withouth fiddling with the metronome

#### Problem statement
---
The usual musical instrument practice routine for a number of musicians is to set the metronome at a certain tempo and keep playing till they get good at it and proceed to higher tempos till the desired speed and dexterity is achieved.
The routine I follow is this:
1. Pick a guitar lick or a drum roll to practice on
2. Pick a tempo that's not too easy or too hard to play at, e.g. 70 bpm
3. Practice at this tempo for a couple of bars, e.g. 10 bars in 4/4
4. Increase the tempo once the dexterity is achieved
5. Repeat from step 2 - 4 till desired final tempo is achieved

This process can be automated if the various tempos and duration of bars can be input initially.

#### Implementation plan
---
[x] Simple metronome based on setInterval
[x] Ability to modify tempo and number of bars
[ ] Add various other tempos and bar duration and create a list/set for practice routine
[ ] Support other time signatures such as 3/4, 7/8 etc
[ ] Settings to change metronome sound and levels
